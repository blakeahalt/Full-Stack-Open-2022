### Part 6 - [State management with Redux](https://fullstackopen.com/en/part6)

This part is focused on _Redux_, which can be used for more complex state management of your _React_ app (covers concepts like immutability, global store, actions and reducers). Also this chapter covers how to use _Redux_ with `hooks`, and how to use the old `connect` higher order component when you work on older code bases, and `redux thunk` for asynchronous code.
